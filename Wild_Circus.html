			Brilda is an incredible snake charmer. She discovered this practice while she was living in India during her youth and she had an eye for this art instantly.

				<h3 id="aside_2">Good to know</h3>
				<P id="aside_p_2">Snake charming is the practice of pretending to hypnotize a snake by playing an instrument called pungi or bansuri. A typical performance may also include handling the snakes or performing other seemingly dangerous acts, as well as other street performance staples, like juggling and sleight of hand. The practice is most common in India, though other Asian nations such as Pakistan,[1] Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia are also home to performers, as are the North African countries of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.</P>

			Gilda is contorsionist. Little girl of a couple of acrobats, brought up in a circus, she knew very early that she would live her life in the glitter that staging can offer. She started to practice her art when she was four years old and she never stopped. She now has an incredible level of contortion and when you will see her performing you won't believe your eyes!</P>

				<P id="aside_p_3">Contortion is a performance art in which performers, contortionists, showcase their skills of extreme physical flexibility. It is the dramatic feats of seemingly inhuman flexibility that captivate audiences. In some countries, such as Russia and Mongolia, contortion holds special cultural significance.</P>
